As the year draws to a close I figured I'd go through my Instapaper archive to highlight various blogs, articles, longreads and how-tos that I thought were neat. This is by no means a thorough list, as I'm purely going on articles I thought to archive rather than delete. And, there's an obvious technology bias towards the content. And there's no guarantees they were all written in 2019 either. Nevertheless, it is presented below in a loosely categorised form.

## Programming

* How to structure a multi-file C program ([part 1](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/structure-multi-file-c-part-1), [part 2](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/structure-multi-file-c-part-2)): A pretty good introduction to starting a small C project from scratch.
* Of a similar note to the above is [Writing Sustainable Python Scripts](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2019-sustainable-python-script).
* [When "Zoë" !== "Zoë"](https://withblue.ink/2019/03/11/why-you-need-to-normalize-unicode-strings.html): Being Unicode-aware in your string handling.
* [Object-oriented Programming: The Trillion Dollar Disaster](https://medium.com/better-programming/object-oriented-programming-the-trillion-dollar-disaster-92a4b666c7c7?). And if you're done with that, take a look at [Functional Programming? Don't Even Bother, It's a Silly Toy](https://medium.com/better-programming/fp-toy-7f52ea0a947e) by the same author.
* [Comparing user Distinguished Names](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-redhat/posts/2019-05-28-a-dn-is-not-a-string.html) is not straightforward when there's many ways it can possibly appear. 
* [Implementing a Regular Expression engine](https://deniskyashif.com/implementing-a-regular-expression-engine/).
* A compilation of [Kubernetes failure stories](https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories) with the goal of helping people learn from other incidents.
* [On Infrastructure at Scale](https://medium.com/@daniel.p.woods/on-infrastructure-at-scale-a-cascading-failure-of-distributed-systems-7cff2a3cd2df) is one such blog linked from the aforementioned compilation. How a networking disruption resulted in a series of events and cascading problems.
* I grew up worshipping the skills of demoscene coders, so [A Mind Is Born](https://linusakesson.net/scene/a-mind-is-born/) was a real treat to read, where the author explains how he wrote a 1st-place-winning demo for the Commodore 64 in just 256 bytes.

## Tech industry and related malaise

* [Lessons from 6 Software Rewrite Stories](https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22): Lovely read about several good and bad case studies involving big rewrites. It was lovely to discover that the New York Times [still has its review of Netscape 6](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/technology/state-of-the-art-netscape-6-browser-mixed-bag.html) online.
* [Data Science is Different Now](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/): This opinion piece makes a case for what skills a growing glut of data scientists should really be learning.
* [Three Years of Misery Inside Google, the Happiest Company in Tech](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-google-three-years-misery-happiest-company-tech/) paints a dire picture.
* [The Trauma Floor: The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona).
* [10 Personal Finance Lessons for Technology Professionals](https://www.troyhunt.com/10-personal-finance-lessons-for-technology-professionals/). I'm still trying to be finance literate.
* [A Business With No End](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/27/style/what-is-inside-this-internet-rabbit-hole.html). This tale of trying to trace the source of a spiderweb of Internet marketplace stores is just mindboggling.
* In a similar vein of shady Internet company sleuthing is [I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb).

## Security

* I admit that I do admire the moxie of those featured in [Smart like a fox](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330752881_Smart_like_a_fox_How_clever_students_trick_dumb_automated_programming_assignment_assessment_systems): How clever students trick dumb automated programming assignment assessment systems.
* [How Dropbox Securely Stores Your Passwords](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/09/how-dropbox-securely-stores-your-passwords/): It's from 2016 so I don't know if it's still current, but it's still a good read and good to see a company be open about such a thing.
* Follow that one up with one from zdnet about a study claiming [programmers will err towards implementing poor password security](https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-shows-programmers-will-take-the-easy-way-out-and-not-implement-proper-password-security/) unless specifically directed.
* [Investigating a Recent eBook DRM System](https://yingtongli.me/blog/2019/03/28/drm2.html): I'm always impressed by the thought processes employed by reverse engineers and this blog is a good example.
* ..as is [Looking Inside The Box](https://anvilventures.com/blog/looking-inside-the-box.html), which discusses reverse engineering the Dropbox client.

## Arts

I apparently do like my horror movie longform articles, so with that said:

* [The Making of The Exorcist](https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2019/10/25/making-exorcist): In a few years The Exorcist will be fifty years old; this article explains why it's lost none of its power to terrify.
* [They Came. They Sawed.](https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/they-came-they-sawed/) is a similar article about the making of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
* [The Mortgaging of Sierra Online](https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online/): Picking a single [Digital Antiquarian](https://www.filfre.net/) article as a "favourite" is a nigh-impossible task, but this entry - which covers Sierra during the peak of mid-90s era CD-ROM multimedia frenzy - triggers the most nostalgia in me.

## Miscellaneous

* [Ghoulish Acts and Dastardly Deeds](https://www.damninteresting.com/ghoulish-acts-dastardly-deeds/): A captivating longform piece about the hunt for a pipebomb terrorist in New York City during the 1950s.
* I watched the excellent documentary Three Identical Strangers this year. [Double Mystery](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/08/07/double-mystery), by the New Yorker, covers some related ground and is an excellent accompaniment. (in order to avoid spoiling its impact, I would strongly recommend watching the documentary first though)
* [27 Questions to Ask Instead of "What Do You Do?"](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054667/27-questions-to-ask-instead-of-what-do-you-do). Asking someone how they feel their life has gone so far is a bit heavy, though.

## Bonus video things

[Noah Gervais'](https://www.youtube.com/user/broadcaststsatic/feed) longform commentaries on games are so good that it finally pushed me over the edge to begin supporting creators on Patreon rather than just blithely consuming content. His series of travelogue videos covering a journey across the American west in a VW Van are so stupendously good, they became a major influence on me doing my own trek through Yosemite this past winter. As one commenter in the videos writes,

> "If aliens find Earth abandoned and dead, I want this video to be the last surviving human recording."

and I couldn't agree more. If you have 90 minutes to kill, watch/listen to [The Desert Bus: A Southwestern Ramble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-naJR_rhkUM). If you have six hours more, then you should really [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD_-b06JJtE) [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89sOyZdtVA0) [rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByRKF1INOcU).
